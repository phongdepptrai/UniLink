## 2024-05-15 - [Added keyboard focus states to main CTA]
**Learning:** Found that custom buttons and links in the primary container often lack default `focus-visible` styles which hurts keyboard accessibility, specifically when relying on Tailwind without custom base styles.
**Action:** Always ensure `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary focus-visible:ring-offset-2` (or similar offset) is added to custom interactive elements.
